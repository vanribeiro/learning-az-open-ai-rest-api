# Integrating Azure Open AI with Front-End

I'm learning to use Azure Open AI. And, in this repository, my intention is to record how to implement REST api consumption from the documentation.

## About this project

Purpose: simple chat that accepts user input and returns a response of a maximum of 300 tokens.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS / SCSS
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Azure Open AI Service REST API
- NodeJS

## Next steps:

- integrate this application with an Azure Function to store environment variables and consume data securely.
- allow the definition of parameters for chat to be defined via form.
